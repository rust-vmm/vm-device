# Changelog

## v0.1.0

This is the first `vm-device` release.
The `vm-device` crate provides device traits defining read and write operations
on specialized buses, a device manager for operating devices and dispatching
I/O, and abstractions for defining resources and their constraints (e.g. a
specific bus address range, IRQ number, etc.).
